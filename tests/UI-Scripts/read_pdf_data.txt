How to check the pdf read in functionality:
    1. go to the apache server and type in http://localhost/Teamprojektsoftwareentwicklung/public/index.php
    2. choose "Uploads" in the menu and upload a relevant pdf
    3. now compare the values you see with the relevant values in the pdf. The items should be the same
    4. save your pdf and check if the values are saved in the database. If no error occur and the values are still the same
        after pressing 'Absenden' than everything is correct.

Note that this is a first version. Most of the code is hardcoded and work only for specific pdfs.
In addition, you can't change the values in the correction page anymore.
