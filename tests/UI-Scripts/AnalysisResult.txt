1. execute the sql script
2. go to Website and log in with "Max Mustermann". This is important because only Max Mustermann has access
to real estate with id 1. Currently every bill saved is linked to real estate with id 1.
3. upload two bills and choose some costs. Make sure the bill YEAR differ only by a year. For example 2019 and 2020.
4. Now, navigate in menu bar to "Prüfungsergebnisse"

6. click on "i" of a bill to see more details
7. In the details you can see what differs more than 10%.

4. if you select "Prüfungsergebnisse" and remove the ID in the URL, the Page Not Found error should appear.
